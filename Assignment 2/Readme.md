# Running Distributed Computing Project

## Setup and Running the Programs

### Step 1: Open Three Terminal Tabs

Navigate to the project directory in each tab:

```bash
cd /Users/Ali_Nawaz/music/Distributed-Computing-TrangoTowers
```

### Step 2: Start the Server

In the first terminal tab, start the server:

```bash
python server.py
```

### Step 3: Start the Web Server

In the second terminal tab, start the web server:

```bash
python WebServer.py
```

### Step 4: Run the Client for Debugging

In the third terminal tab, run the client:

```bash
python client.py 127.0.0.1
```

Replace `127.0.0.1` with the appropriate IP if running on a different machine.

## Accessing the Web Interface

- **On Your Local Machine**:  
  Open a web browser and go to:

  ```
  http://localhost:8548/
  ```

- **On the Aviary Network**:  
  If running this in the Aviary environment, access it through:
  ```
  http://hawk.cs.umanitoba.ca:8548/
  ```

## Running the Screen Scraper Program

### Step 1: Compile the Program

In the project directory, compile with:

```bash
make
```

### Step 2: Execute the Screen Scraper

Run the screen scraper with the following syntax:

```bash
./screen_scraper [host] [port] [username] [message]
```

#### Example (on your local machine):

```bash
./screen_scraper 127.0.0.1 8000 Ali "Very Sunny Day today!"
```

### Running Curl HTTP Commands to test API Routes :


2. GET /api/messages fetches messages, has query string to limit how many messages are fetched

4. GET/POST /api/messages return appropriate error message when not logged in

5. POST /api/login sets cookie, DELETE removes cookie

   For a user that's not logged in :
   curl -X GET "http://130.179.28.113:8548/api/messages"
   [nawaza1@eagle Assignment 2]> curl -X GET "http://130.179.28.113:8548/api/messages"
{"error": "Not logged in"}[nawaza1@eagle Assignment 2]>

Working as expected ^^^^^


### Justification on Cookie login Verification with ScreenScraper : 

In the ScreenScraper program, cookie-based authentication is implemented to allow or restrict access based on the presence of a nickname cookie. When a username (nickname) is provided as an argument, it is added to the Cookie header (e.g., Cookie: nickname=Ali) in the POST and GET requests, simulating an authenticated user. The server checks for this cookie to confirm the user is logged in and allows access if itâ€™s present. If no username is provided, the program omits the Cookie header, simulating an unauthenticated request. In this case, the server responds with a 403 Forbidden error, denying access to both posting and retrieving messages. This setup enables the program to test both authenticated and unauthenticated scenarios, verifying proper access control based on the presence of the cookie.
