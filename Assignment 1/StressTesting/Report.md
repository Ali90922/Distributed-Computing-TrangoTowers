Report

Create a minimum of 7 data points each with a different number of clients, starting with 1 client, and with a maximum of 200. (1,2,5,10,20,50,100,200 is a nice set of clients) More, if you can!

Tried using the AWS and Azure, but resorted back to using two different machines on the Aviary network. My server is on kingfisher and all the clients are on hawk.cs.umanitoba.ca.
